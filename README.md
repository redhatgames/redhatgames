## Hey there, so nice to see you! ðŸ‘‹
### We're Redhat Games, but you can just call us the Redhats. ðŸ§¢
We create games, sites, projects and much more! You can find us on GitHub, [Itch](https://redhats.itch.io/), and even [Twitter](https://twitter.com/redhatsofficial)!

### ðŸ¤” What are we doin'?
We've entered the [Black & White Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/bw-jam/) on Itch to be our first Game Jam and first game. Meanwhile we're thinking of getting our own GitHub Page. Nah, no fancy domain bought yet but it might be later.

### ðŸŒ± Every day is a chance to learn.
We're currently learning Java (not Java*Script*) for things in the future, like Minecraft mods and other things.

### ðŸ‘¯ Makin' new friends!
Calling all sound designers, we're lookin' to collab! Reach out to us with the email address below with one of your songs and we'll say if you have what we're lookin' for.

### âš¡ Fun Fact!
We got our name from Carmen Sandiego.

### ðŸ’¬ Reachin' out.
You can always talk to us. Our email is [here](mailto:studio.redhat@gmail.com) and you can always comment on one of our Itch games.
